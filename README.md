# dotFiles
My personal favorite [dot] files which I would love to share



**NOTE**: Make sure you've got a few stuff before you're expecting things to work out of the box

##### Stuff you'll need

- [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch)
- [antibody](https://getantibody.github.io/)
- [lsd](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd)
- [chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma) / pygmentize
- [neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- [nerdfonts*](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)

**NOTE**: If some shell commands like `cat`, `less`, etc. are bugging you please add a backslash `\` before the command. Making it look like `\cat > lulz << EOF`

*You may also use any other **supported** font(s) too :slightly_smiling_face:
